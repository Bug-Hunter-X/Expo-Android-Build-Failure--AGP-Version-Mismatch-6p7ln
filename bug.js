This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves a mismatch between the version of the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) used by your project and the version supported by the Expo build tools.  The error message might not clearly indicate the AGP version conflict, but it will usually involve build failures related to Gradle or Android dependencies.  For example, you might see errors indicating that certain classes or methods are missing, or that dependencies cannot be resolved.

Example Error (May vary):
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
