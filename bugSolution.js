To solve the AGP version mismatch, you will need to ensure that your `android/build.gradle` and potentially `gradle-wrapper.properties` files are configured with a compatible AGP version.  Expo's documentation should list supported versions. You might need to check the Expo release notes or community forums for the most up-to-date compatible AGP version.

1. **Identify the Incompatible Version:** Carefully examine the error messages during the build process. Look for lines mentioning a specific AGP version it cannot find or resolve.
2. **Check Expo's Documentation:** Consult the Expo documentation (or release notes) for the recommended or supported AGP versions for your Expo CLI version.
3. **Update `android/build.gradle`:** Modify the `buildscript` block in your `android/build.gradle` file to specify the correct AGP version.  Example:
```gradle
buildscript {
    ext {
        kotlinVersion = "1.8.22"
    }
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.2") // Update this line
        classpath("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:${kotlinVersion}")
    }
}
```
4. **(Optional) Update `gradle-wrapper.properties`:** If necessary, also adjust the Gradle version in `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` to ensure compatibility. It's often best to use the Gradle version recommended by the AGP version you've selected.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Clean your project's build directory and then try building the app again.  This ensures that any cached files from the previous build (using the incompatible version) are removed.

```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
expo start --android
```
